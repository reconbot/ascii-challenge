# ASCII Challenge

This printable HTML file is an ASCII / Binary chart that's ad free and non scummy, AND a little bit of JS to make a message for decoding. When you print it the CSS hides the actual message and ensures the chart is on it's own page. So fire it up, make a message, hit print and enjoy!

It suits my purposes, but happy to take PRs or advice to make it more friendly for kids and adults alike.
